Srikar's notes:
sprintbot7 was our sprint submission. Tests run on maps progress, valley, tower, stronghold, fortress, intersection, equals, underground
Created restart (built off of sprintbot7). Fixing archon scouting location sorting bug: restart wins 8/8 as red and 5/8 as blue
Created restart2 (built off of restart). Made miners completely eat lead if in enemy territory and used rubble sensing for symmetry: restart2 wins 6/8 as red and 5/8 as blue
Updated restart2. Changed soldier code so that it goes towards center instead of trying to follow miners. Now it's cracked af.



sprintbot10 vs sprintbot7
test 1: added in smth (goes towards enemy archons instead of going towards miners)
test 2: copied archon code (repair priority and sorting bug)
test 3: miners eat enemy lead and rubble based symmetry. Also added in soldier assassins
